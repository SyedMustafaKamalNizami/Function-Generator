# Function-Generator
Function generator using arduino and AD9833 DDS ic

Project Overview

This project is a low-cost, Arduino-based function generator built using the AD9833 Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) module. It is capable of generating sine, square, and triangular waveforms with a frequency range of 1 Hz to 12.5 MHz and a peak-to-peak output amplitude of up to 12V (via external amplification). The system features a rotary encoder and pushbutton interface for adjusting parameters and an I2C LCD for real-time display. It is ideal for educational and basic lab applications.
Complete technical details, testing results, circuit schematic, and analysis are included in the attached project report.
